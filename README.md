# Vanilla JS Todolist App

This is a todo app made wit vanilla JS. Now, that might sound easier but it's really not. Having to do it with vanilla JavaScript means that I needed to create every DOM element using the `createElement` method. Aside from that I also made it pretty with great font and styling.
